## **📚 Background**
I've been playing chess since I was 5 years old. I spent years studying the game, honing my skills, and competing in tournaments. However, as I entered my teenage years, I set aside my chessboard to focus on completing my engineering degree.

After graduation, I began working as a Chess instructor at NMCA/KCT, where I was tasked to help make the city of Coimbatore a bigger hub for chess. My work involved creating reports of tournaments, finding out the best time to conduct tournaments, chess events and also to help budding talents develop their game. Here is where I also discovered my love for programming, I needed to update content in the website blogs regularly and I wanted to do it without any help from the developers. One thing led to another and I was soon adept at HTML, CSS and was loving solving problems with Javascript. Being around the game reignited my own passion, and I also started playing again, eager to put my skills to the test. But just as I was getting back into the swing of things, the COVID-19 pandemic hit.

Although I wasnt able to play chess in person, I still continued to explore the software industry. I was fascinated by how it allowed me to solve complex problems and build new things from scratch.

I landed a job at Time2Chess, a startup, which required an extensive knowledge of Chess, operations and programming. I created the landing website, tools, and platforms. My work at Time2Chess sparked my interest in data analysis, which led me to pursue a career in data science. 

## **📂 Projects**

- **[General Trends in Chess](https://github.com/EshwanthJ/Trends_in_Chess)**: This project analyzes trends in chess games from the TWIC (This Week in Chess) magazine dataset, covering games from 2012 to mid-2022. Key focuses include examining the number of games played each year (both online and offline) and exploring the relationship between game outcomes and player ratings. The analysis provides insights into the dynamics of competitive chess in the past decade
- **[Global Power Plants](https://github.com/EshwanthJ/global_power_plants)**: This project involves an in-depth analysis of global power generation capacity. The process begins with data preparation, including cleaning and combining dataframes, creating columns for rank and plant information, and setting up dataframes for capacity and fuel, along with a color palette for primary fuel types. The exploratory data analysis covers power generation capacity by country and sub-regions, as well as cumulative percentages for capacity and primary fuel. Finally, the project features world maps highlighting power generation in China, the USA, and India.
