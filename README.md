### Projects

- **[General Trends in Chess](https://github.com/EshwanthJ/Trends_in_Chess)**: This project analyzes trends in chess games from the TWIC (This Week in Chess) magazine dataset, covering games from 2012 to mid-2022. Key focuses include examining the number of games played each year (both online and offline) and exploring the relationship between game outcomes and player ratings. The analysis provides insights into the dynamics of competitive chess in the past decade
- **[Global Power Plants](https://github.com/EshwanthJ/global_power_plants)**: This project involves an in-depth analysis of global power generation capacity. The process begins with data preparation, including cleaning and combining dataframes, creating columns for rank and plant information, and setting up dataframes for capacity and fuel, along with a color palette for primary fuel types. The exploratory data analysis covers power generation capacity by country and sub-regions, as well as cumulative percentages for capacity and primary fuel. Finally, the project features world maps highlighting power generation in China, the USA, and India.
